== My Personal Workspace ==
=== Migration ===
GCdocs allows for the migration of your '''personal-professional''' documents and e-mails to your Personal Workspace. Once your content has been migrated to GCdocs, you will always have access to your records when needed.

These video tutorials and presentations will show you the various methods for saving your items. 

==== Saving Documents ====

* [[Media:201809_-_Outlook_-_Moving_whole_folders.pdf|Outlook: Moving whole folders (PowerPoint)]]

NOTE: All personal-professional documents and e-mails are required to follow the [https://gcdocs.gc.ca/dfo-mpo/llisapi.dll/Open/681776 Business Rules and Best Practices for GCdocs].

==== Business Rules and Best Practices ====

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Business Rules
! Best Practices
|-
| style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;"  |
# Each user will have a personal workspace in GCdocs. The personal workspace is intended to be used for managing documents of a personal-professional nature, and in accordance with [http://intra.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ss/documents/corp/policy/Acceptable_Use_of_Electronic_Networks_Policy.pdf Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use] and [http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/9/99/Standard_on_the_Storage_of_Electronic_Information.DOCX IM Standard for the Storage of Electronic Information].
# A user’s personal workspace will be setup as accessible only to the user and GCdocs Administrators but the user will retain control over access to their personal space.  
# Users must limit access to their personal workspace to every extent possible.  If a document in one’s personal workspace must be shared, there is likely a folder to share it within the enterprise workspace where access can be limited as required rather than permitting access to one’s personal workspace.
# All information of business value must be stored within the enterprise workspace, even in draft form.  There are access controls available to document owners that allow them to limit access to their documents until they are prepared to share more broadly.
# Users are responsible for utilizing their Personal Workspace responsibly.  Regular monitoring and reporting will be conducted on the size of Personal Workspaces and targeted document types (e.g. videos and photos).  Information Management Services may follow-up with employees, if required, to request that clean-up actions be performed.  
# Remember, content remaining in a user’s personal workspace will be deleted 30 days following their departure from the Department - [http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/f/f5/IM_Standard_for_Departing_Employees.DOCX IM Standard for Departing Employees].

''Justification: As this space is not meant to store documents of business value, it will not be retained for future departmental use once the employee leaves the department.  Also, limiting access to one’s personal workspace, where at all possible, mitigates any risk that another employee may access any personal information contained therein.''

| style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;" |
# Users must not save information of business value in their personal workspace as it cannot be shared with colleagues and will be lost should the employee depart unexpectedly. The content should be deleted when the employee leaves the department. 
# Personal-professional items, such as an email referencing an employee’s performance agreement, resume, personal HR files, etc. are examples of what may be kept in this area.
# Users are encouraged to review the contents of their Personal Workspace regularly (every two years at a minimum) and perform clean-up actions to maintain an organized Personal Workspace environment.  
''Justification: Information of business value must be accessible to other employees requiring it for their duties and be accessible for ATIP searches.  Regularly deleting information that is no longer useful will help maintain respectable electronic storage levels for the department.''

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=== General Info - GCdocs ===
{{Collapse
|1=Currently, DFO does not have an information management system for all employees who create or handle electronic information. This has resulted in the storage of information in various places (EKME, shared drives, hard drives, external drives, email, etc.). This information is siloed, not accessible to all who need it, not managed throughout its lifecycle, and not always secure. 
*DFO employees currently have to deal with over 400 terabytes of electronic information and these staggering amounts are growing daily;
*Having to hunt for information when you need it is time consuming and inefficient: research suggests that we lose about 15 – 25% of every work day chasing documents;
*Not being able to find the information when you need it is a major risk: we are bound by law to be able to produce information when it’s needed (e.g. for ATIP requests); and
*Our emails contain much of the information that is valuable to the Department and to Canada. As emails are not stored in a central place, the information can be lost when an employee leaves the department.
|2=Why do we need GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1=GCdocs offers us a number of benefits:
*One shared repository: Allowing you to access the DFO information you need from anywhere across the Department; 
*Version control: Will make it easier to know that you’re working on the most recent version;
*Powerful search capability: Giving you much faster searches that will save time usually spent hunting for information;
*Collaboration environment: As GCdocs is accessible by your colleagues across the Department, you will no longer have to send attachments out for comments by email and then have to merge all the comments; and;
*Security: Allows you to store up to and including Protected B documents on GCdocs.
|2=How will GCdocs benefit us?}}

{{Collapse
|1=GCdocs is the Government of Canada Electronic Document Records Management Solution (EDRMS) that will optimize how information is saved, shared, found, protected, organized and disposed of.  GCdocs will replace the current Electronic Knowledge Management Environment (EKME) and will be the only approved electronic information repository at DFO. 
|2=What is GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' -  GCdocs will provide the Department with one common repository for electronic information (not including data in other applications or databases). It will speed up information retrieval, facilitate faster decision-making, improve our responses to legislative requirements (ATIP, litigation), and allow the Department to effectively manage its electronic information throughout its lifecycle. 
|2=What will GCdocs do to improve this?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' -  GCdocs should facilitate cost savings in the long-term. Public Works and Government Services will provide IT support to the system for all Government Departments, freeing up Departmental resources to work on other things. In addition, the system should provide you, the employee, with efficiencies related to searching and retrieving the information you need.

<p>For instance, when searching for information, DFO employees currently have to sift through more than 1.3 terabytes of electronic information in EKME and another 335.66 terabytes in shared drives. This does not include what employees have stored in email or on external drives or internal hard drives.</p>
|2='''Is this another cost saving exercise?'''}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' -  GCdocs will provide a secure, one-repository solution for all of your information. A new Departmental file plan is being developed that will allow us all to keep all of our information in the same place. Information will be easy to find and simple to store, based on their function / purpose.  
|2=What will  GCdocs do for me?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - GCdocs will replace the current Electronic Knowledge Management Environment (EKME) and will be the only approved electronic information repository at DFO. Licences will be made available to all those who will require it. EKME and shared drive use will be phased out where possible. It will be mandatory to use GCdocs unless there is a strong business case to justify an alternate information management solution.
|2=Will the use of GCdocs be optional or mandatory?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - GCdocs will be housed on a secure (up to and including Protected B) server located in Barrie, Ontario.
|2=Where will GCdocs be physically housed?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Shared Services Canada (SSC) will be responsible for maintaining the server on which GCdocs will be housed. The Information Management and Information Technology (IM&TS) Directorate of DFO will be responsible for the administration of the system on behalf of DFO.
|2=Who will be responsible for maintaining the GCdocs network?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes. This will be part of the regular maintenance that SSC will perform on behalf of departments.  
|2=Will GCdocs be regularly backed up?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - No. When a document is opened by somebody else, there will be a red check mark on the document icon, indicating that it is currently ‘reserved’. They will be able to open the properties of the document so that they can see who has the document open. They can contact them to discuss the document availability. The document can still be opened in ‘read-only’ mode. There is also an option to download and work on a document offline, then upload a new version into GCdocs at a later time.
|2=When I am editing a document/file, can somebody else open it and make changes?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes, you can delete documents you created yourself, so long as you follow the retention and disposition schedules in place and established information management guidelines for disposal. For example, if you created a duplicate document in error, it would be appropriate to delete the duplicate document.
|2=Can I delete my own documents?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - There is a recycling bin where you can retrieve and restore your document or folder.   
|2=What happens if I delete a document or a folder my mistake?}} 

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Although you could technically use any browser, Internet Explorer is the best browser to use as it is the official browser that is fully supported by the IT Service Desk.   
|2=Which browser is the best to use to run GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - GCdocs is considered a ‘light’ application for your computer because it is housed on the network rather than each individual computer.  Similarly, PeopleSoft is also a network-based application.  Keep in mind, that while it will not require a lot of memory on your computer, it will be dependent on network availability and speed.
|2=How much memory/space on my computer will GCdocs require to operate?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - GCdocs is currently security certified for saving up to and including Protected B.  A Secret instance option (housed on a secure network) is currently being pursued and piloted by another Department but it will not be ready for DFO to use at its initial roll-out.   
|2=Can we save Secret, Top Secret or Confidential information in GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Protocols for saving and retaining documents above the Protected B level should be no different than what you do now.  Use an encrypted USB stick on a non-network connected workstation, and store accordingly (locked filing cabinet, combination safe, etc.).
|2=What do we do with documents classified above the Protected B level?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Permissions will be set by directorates when the folder structure is established.  Documents will inherit the access and security permissions as set at the folder level.  Folders will be set to “open” by default, otherwise known as ‘read-only’, to all GCdocs users in DFO and the Canadian Coast Guard unless otherwise requested by the directorate.
|2=Who assigns permissions to a document or folder?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes, so long as the PDF document has been Optical Character Recognition enabled (OCRed).  Most PDF documents are OCRed if created within the last few years.
|2=Can you search PDFs full text in GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - The GCdocs team, along with directorates, will establish user groups based on your business/function and access permissions will be granted at the folder level. These established groups and permissions will determine who can see, edit, or delete documents. Document owners always have full control of who accesses their own documents. They can increase or decrease access and permissions on their documents if / as required.
|2=Will everyone be able to see, edit or delete my documents?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes,you can set notifications on a particular document using the drop down menu to the right of the listed document.  You can receive notifications when the document’s status changes (e.g. reserved), a version has been added, or a version status has changed.  You can choose whether to receive reports instantly, daily, or weekly.
|2=Is GCdocs set up to enable notifications when there has been activity on a document?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes. A document is automatically ‘reserved’ when being edited by one user.  Users can set up notifications to be advised when the document is available for edit next or they can choose to work offline and upload a new version later once they are notified that the document is available again.  The document can still be opened as ‘read-only’ when it is reserved.
|2=When collaborating on a document and you send a group a document link for their input, will only one user be able to edit the document at a time?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - A document will remain ‘reserved’ unless the user closes it.  A document is automatically ‘reserved’ when being edited by one user.  Users can set up notifications to be advised when the document is available for edit or they can choose to work offline and upload a new version later once they are notified that the document is available.

<p>If the user is away on leave and immediate access to the document is required, please contact the Information Management Branch via the IT Service Desk online IT Request system. Administrators will be able to forcibly close the document.  This is considered a last resort option and should not become a common occurrence.</p>
|2=If a user forgets to close a document; can you still open it and edit it?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Not at this time. This is the long-term vision, but for the foreseeable future, GCdocs will not allow interdepartmental sharing capabilities. If you collaborate with other departments, your method of sharing documents will not change. If you currently send documents outside the Department via email, you can attach a copy to an email easily from Outlook.   

|2=Will GCdocs allow us to share between other governmental departments?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes. Access is limited to 'read-only' for the time being but increased interoperability is expected in the future.
|2=Is GCdocs compatible with my Blackberry?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes. If your laptop is equipped with a connection allowing you to work from home (SVPN) – if you can connect to the DFO network now – yes, you will be able to access GCdocs from anywhere outside your office provided that you have an internet connection.   
|2=Can I access GCdocs from home?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - You will stay logged in for 12 hours unless you close the browser. Remember, for security reasons, be sure to lock your computer every time you leave your work station.
|2=How long will you stay logged into GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes, but only to a certain degree, the extent to which will be decided.
|2=Can I override prefilled fields when creating a document profile?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes, there is a way to create records to reference physical objects which includes paper holdings and other forms of media that cannot be stored directly in GCdocs.  If this will be a requirement for your directorate, please identify this when establishing your GCdocs folder structure.
|2=Is there a way to reference paper holdings in GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes.
|2=Can users drag favourites from GCdocs to the browser bar, desktop, etc. for easy accessibility?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - You can reserve a document, download and then sync once network access is restored to upload the edits made to the document.
|2=How can you use GCdocs on Coast Guard ships or Conservation and Protection vessels when network accessibility and availability is severely limited?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - No, but the document can be exported from GCdocs to One Note to do the simultaneous editing and then imported back into GCdocs afterwards.
|2=Can we use One Note and do simultaneous editing in GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Please email [mailto:DFO.InfoServ-ServInfo.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca DFO.InfoServ-ServInfo.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca] with details of the issue and we will work with the Learning Solutions team to review.
|2=I found an issue with the CSPS course. (e.g.; broken link, difficulty completing a step, etc.) What do I do?}}

{{Collapse

===Migrating to GCdocs===
{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - The implementation will be a staggered approach. The goal is to have the majority of the Department implemented to GCdocs over 2018/19. To keep track of the status of specific Sectors, Internal and Operational Directorates, please refer to [[#Onboarding_-_Progress_to_Date|On-boarding - Progress to Date]]
|2=When will we get GCdocs ?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Yes, all users of GCdocs will receive training through courses offered by the Canadian School of the Public Service. 
|2=Will I receive training?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Initially all land-based computer users at DFO will be issued user names and passwords however, they will only have ‘read-only’ access. Further permissions will be set once consultations with directorates have been completed and the resulting folder structures approved and created. Calendars and engagement are being developed with GCdocs coordinators.
|2=How will GCdocs be implemented?}}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - Directorates can request a report of their shared drive contents that shows duplicate files and other potential easy items for possible deletion (e.g. photos and music files).  The directorate would then have to identify which documents of those identified can actually be deleted. On an individual level, employees are encouraged to clean up their email inboxes and personal storage spaces (such as U: drives) as much as possible. These measures also support information management best practices and other transformation initiatives such as the Email Transformation Initiative (ETI).            
|2=How can directorates and individuals prepare for GCdocs implementation?}}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - It is not recommended that large amounts of finalized records be migrated into GCdocs without the assistance of IM and a tool to ensure that key metadata components are retained.  

You can move documents directly from EKME, shared drives, or Outlook into GCdocs by dragging and dropping them into GCdocs if/as required.  While a migration strategy is being finalized and tools are procured, a “day forward” approach is strongly recommended. This entails saving anything currently being worked on within GCdocs including any records regularly opened or used. While the intent is to eventually set shared drives to ‘read only’ (with exceptions) and decommission EKME, this will not occur until a migration strategy has been finalized and in place.  

Employees will always have access to the records they require to perform their duties.
|2=How do we migrate documents into GCdocs?}}
      
{{Collapse
|1= '''A''' - A migration strategy is being developed which includes the procurement of a tool to help with the migration of large volumes of documents. This tool will retain the original metadata (e.g. document date).

Currently, when an employee drags and drops a document from their shared drive, Outlook or EKME into GCdocs, the original metadata will not be retained (e.g. document creation date will be the date the document was transferred into GCdocs). 

The migration strategy will ensure that that the necessary metadata is mapped and integrity maintained when documents are migrated into GCdocs from EKME and shared drives. Directorates should also raise these issues when the Information Management business analysts meet with them to discuss their requirements for their GCdocs folder structure. 
|2=Will the document date and other metadata be maintained when documents are migrated into GCdocs?}}

<div style="text-align: right;">
[[#Frequently_Asked_Questions|<u>↑ Back to Top (FAQs)</u>]]
</div>
<hr/>

===What Will Happen to My Existing Information?===
{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - This will not be completed automatically prior to GCdocs implementation. A migration strategy is in development. The EKME, subject-based, file plan will be mapped to the new, function-based folder structure to facilitate this process.
|2=Will EKME documents be migrated directly into GCdocs automatically when GCdocs is rolled out? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - No. DFO’s vast shared drives are not well organized at this time and contain many duplicate and transitory documents that do not need to be transferred into GCdocs. It would not be the best use of resources to migrate a large amount of unorganized documents without first ensuring that only information resources of business value were being transferred. Understandably, cleaning up our shared drives will require substantial resources (human, financial, and time) that many directorates do not have readily available at this time thus we are suggesting that sectors at a minimum take a ‘day forward’ approach. This requires that they begin saving anything currently being worked on from that point on within GCdocs, including anything regularly opened or used.  A migration strategy is in development.                  
|2=Will we be migrating shared drive content into GCdocs immediately? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - Although GCdocs has tracking capabilities, GCCMS will remain in place and will be integrated with GCdocs.   
|2=Will GCdocs replace GCCMS – the correspondence tracking system currently in place? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - Each GCdocs user will have a Personal Workspace within GCdocs that will provide the same purpose as the current personal drives.  
|2=Will employees still have a personal drive (e.g. U: Drive)? }}

===How Will GCdocs Help Me with Email Management?===
{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - No. Many DFO employees have gotten accustomed to using MS Outlook as an information management tool because of its great search capacity; however, this will soon become increasingly problematic for individuals.   Personal Storage Table (PST) files will soon no longer be supported and thus individuals will no longer be able to open them or repair them should they become corrupted.  In addition, inbox sizes will soon be capped at 1.5 GB.  Many from di within Outlook making the process easy, depending on personal preference.  Employees will quickly learn to view email as either transitory (can be deleted) or as an information resource of business value (should be saved in an appropriate, accessible folder within GCdocs) instead of just keeping every email and relying on the search function within MS Outlook.
|2=Will e-mail be the hardest to migrate to GCdocs? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - The search function in GCdocs is very powerful. It has full-text search capability which means that GCdocs will look for the key words you provided in a document name and in the body of documents and emails. The use of email folders will make searching easier as well because more fields are viewed.       
|2= How easy will it be to find an email I just saved in GCdocs?}}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - For maintaining the integrity of the email (legal purposes), you should not change the subject header on an email when you save it into GCdocs.  It is possible, however it is not recommended.  It is important to properly name emails at the time of creation so that the subject header reflects the email content. You can also add details of the email into the description field so that the email is easy to find.  Both the content of the email and the description field are full-text searchable. The use of email folders allows one to rename the record without changing the subject line.
|2=Can you change the subject header on an email? }}      

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - Saving an encrypted email into GCdocs should be avoided: In the event that the owner of that email leaves the Department, there is no way to decrypt the message, rendering the content useless. Emails should be decrypted prior to saving them in GCdocs.  Remember, permissions can be restricted once in GCdocs to ensure proper security of the information contained therein.  Please note that that key Information Management employees will be able to adjust these permissions accordingly if the owner were to leave the Department.  Information up to and including Protected B can be saved in GCdocs without encryption, with the folder permissions/restrictions in place to ensure that the information is available to only those who need access.

===GCdocs File Management===
{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - No, not yet. The folder structure, or file plan for DFO / Canadian Coast Guard is currently in developments collaboratively with Directorates in 2018/19. Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has developed a generic folder structure for Internal Services (e.g. human resources, finance) however, this will have to be adjusted through consultation with directorates to meet DFO needs. In addition, a folder structure for our programs and operations will need to be created during this period. The '[https://gcdocs.gc.ca/dfo-mpo/llisapi.dll/open/681311 Open for Business]' principles will be used to create the folder structure.       
|2=Does the folder structure, or file plan for GCdocs already exist? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - The DFO folder structure will be developed in consultation with directorates who will be prompted to request regional input and identify regional variances. Key regional contacts will also be asked to provide input prior to folder structure creation within GCdocs. As this structure is in development, no further information on the structure, or regional variances, is yet available to share.   
|2=How will the Regions be included in the GCdocs folder structure development? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - GCdocs has the capability to see a document through each stage of the information management life cycle, including disposition. Please note, disposition will not occur without the final approval by the Office of Primary Interest (OPI). When records have met their retention period, a report will be generated and sent to the OPI (e.g. Director of the unit) requesting approval for their disposition. Existing retention and disposition schedules will be incorporated into the folder structure when setting up each folder. Each document within a folder will inherit its retention period and its permissions however, an OPI can decide to keep a document longer than its established retention period if it remains to be of business value.   
|2=Will disposition be automated in GCdocs? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - The plan is to run reports on a quarterly basis. The frequency may need to change once the volume of information grows.         
|2=How often will this Disposition Reports be sent to the OPI for review and approval? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - Disposition date will be determined by the relevant retention and disposition schedule and the triggers previously identified. These may be lengthened at the request of the appropriate directorate if necessary, but they cannot be shortened without a complete review of the applicable retention and disposition schedule due to the legal implications.      
|2=How will the disposition date be determined? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - The management of versions is quite versatile and comprehensive in GCdocs.  Whether a directorate will use linear (1, 2, 3, etc.) or major and minor (1.0, 1.1, 1.2 1.3, 2.0, etc.) versions will be decided by individual directorates. While the Information Management Branch will provide guidelines and best practices, it recognizes that version management is highly preferential and the Branch will not enforce one way or another.   
|2=Are we going to use Major and Minor Versions? }}

{{Collapse
|1='''A''' - No, it cannot. The document audit function (found under the properties of the document) will list every action taken and this list cannot be deleted. You can however manage versions of the document, which is actually a very good IM best practice. 
|2=Can the document history be wiped? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - GCdocs will allow you to create subfolders once you are down to a certain level of the folder structure. However, it would be wise to limit the number of subfolders your work unit creates to promote a better filing structure and avoid having to drill down too many layers to get to your documents. The GCdocs team will work with directorates to create a folder structure that best meets business requirements.
|2=Will we be able to create subfolders? }}

{{Collapse
|1= '''A''' - No. As with folder structure, having a set naming convention can help reduce the guessing game for employees who are searching for specific documents. A naming convention will not be prescribed, but rather suggested as a best practice.  It will not be enforced by the IM Branch, but can be enforced within a directorate.  Finding documents in GCdocs will be much more intuitive with the new folder structure and if required, the search function for findings misplaced documents is so refined that it can find key words in titles and document content. You can also search using the Boolean Search
function (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search.   
|2=Will there be a naming convention and/or Thesaurus as part of the GCdocs roll-out? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - There will only be one repository for all of DFO. The central repository will be accessible by all DFO GCdocs users.  If and when the Secret instance of GCdocs becomes available to DFO, select users may have one other.
|2=How many repositories will there be for DFO? }}

{{Collapse
|1=  '''A''' - Yes. Those information resources that are migrated into GCdocs from EKME and shared drives will be accessible through GCdocs and those remaining in shared drives will be ‘read-only’ for continued accessibility. Enduring Information Resources of Business Value (IRBVs) will be sent to Library and Archives Canada (LAC) electronically for continued storage.
|2=Will GCdocs users be able to access legacy files? }}
