<p>Currently, DFO does not have an information management system for all employees who create or handle electronic information. This has resulted in the storage of information in various places (EKME, shared drives, hard drives, external drives, email, etc.). This information is siloed, not accessible to all who need it, not managed throughout its lifecycle, and not always secure. DFO employees currently have to deal with over 400 terabytes of electronic information and these staggering amounts are growing daily;</p>
<ul>
<li>Having to hunt for information when you need it is time consuming and inefficient: research suggests that we lose about 15 – 25% of every work day chasing documents;</li>
<li>Not being able to find the information when you need it is a major risk: we are bound by law to be able to produce information when it’s needed (e.g. for ATIP requests); and</li>
<li>Our emails contain much of the information that is valuable to the Department and to Canada. As emails are not stored in a central place, the information can be lost when an employee leaves the department.</li>

 <p>GCdocs is the Government of Canada Electronic Document Records Management Solution (EDRMS) that will optimize how information is saved, shared, found, protected, organized and disposed of. GCdocs will replace the current Electronic Knowledge Management Environment (EKME) and will be the only approved electronic information repository at DFO. </p>

<p>GCdocs will provide the Department with one common repository for electronic information (not including data in other applications or databases). It will speed up information retrieval, facilitate faster decision-making, improve our responses to legislative requirements (ATIP, litigation), and allow the Department to effectively manage its electronic information throughout its lifecycle. </p>

<p>GCdocs should facilitate cost savings in the long-term. Public Works and Government Services will provide IT support to the system for all Government Departments, freeing up Departmental resources to work on other things. In addition, the system should provide you, the employee, with efficiencies related to searching and retrieving the information you need. </p>
<p>For instance, when searching for information, DFO employees currently have to sift through more than 1.3 terabytes of electronic information in EKME and another 335.66 terabytes in shared drives. This does not include what employees have stored in email or on external drives or internal hard drives.</p>

GCdocs will provide a secure, one-repository solution for all of your information. A new Departmental file plan is being developed that will allow us all to keep all of our information in the same place. Information will be easy to find and simple to store, based on their function / purpose.

GCdocs will replace the current Electronic Knowledge Management Environment (EKME) and will be the only approved electronic information repository at DFO. Licences will be made available to all those who will require it. EKME and shared drive use will be phased out where possible. It will be mandatory to use GCdocs unless there is a strong business case to justify an alternate information management solution.

No. When a document is opened by somebody else, there will be a red check mark on the document icon, indicating that it is currently ‘reserved’. They will be able to open the properties of the document so that they can see who has the document open. They can contact them to discuss the document availability. The document can still be opened in ‘read-only’ mode. There is also an option to download and work on a document offline, then upload a new version into GCdocs at a later time.

Yes, you can delete documents you created yourself, so long as you follow the retention and disposition schedules in place and established information management guidelines for disposal. For example, if you created a duplicate document in error, it would be appropriate to delete the duplicate document.

GCdocs is considered a ‘light’ application for your computer because it is housed on the network rather than each individual computer. Similarly, PeopleSoft is also a network-based application. Keep in mind, that while it will not require a lot of memory on your computer, it will be dependent on network availability and speed.

Permissions will be set by directorates when the folder structure is established. Documents will inherit the access and security permissions as set at the folder level.

The GCdocs team, along with directorates, will establish user groups based on your business/function and access permissions will be granted at the folder level. These established groups and permissions will determine who can see, edit, or delete documents. Document owners always have full control of who accesses their own documents. They can increase or decrease access and permissions on their documents if / as required.

Yes. A document is automatically ‘reserved’ when being edited by one user.

A document will remain ‘reserved’ unless the user closes it. A document is automatically ‘reserved’ when being edited by one user. Users can set up notifications to be advised when the document is available for edit or they can choose to work offline and upload a new version later once they are notified that the document is available. 
If the user is away on leave and immediate access to the document is required, please contact the Information Management Branch via the IT Service Desk online IT Request system. Administrators will be able to forcibly close the document. This is considered a last resort option and should not become a common occurrence.

Initially all land-based computer users at DFO will be issued user names and passwords however, they will only have ‘read-only’ access.

Directorates can request a report of their shared drive contents that shows duplicate files and other potential easy items for possible deletion (e.g. photos and music files). The directorate would then have to identify which documents of those identified can actually be deleted. On an individual level, employees are encouraged to clean up their email inboxes and personal storage spaces (such as U: drives) as much as possible. These measures also support information management best practices and other transformation initiatives such as the Email Transformation Initiative (ETI).

It is not recommended that large amounts of finalized records be migrated into GCdocs without the assistance of IM and a tool to ensure that key metadata components are retained. 
You can move documents directly from EKME, shared drives, or Outlook into GCdocs by dragging and dropping them into GCdocs if/as required. While a migration strategy is being finalized and tools are procured, a “day forward” approach is strongly recommended. This entails saving anything currently being worked on within GCdocs including any records regularly opened or used. While the intent is to eventually set shared drives to ‘read only’ (with exceptions) and decommission EKME, this will not occur until a migration strategy has been finalized and in place. 
Employees will always have access to the records they require to perform their duties.

A migration strategy is being developed which includes the procurement of a tool to help with the migration of large volumes of documents. This tool will retain the original metadata (e.g. document date). 
Currently, when an employee drags and drops a document from their shared drive, Outlook or EKME into GCdocs, the original metadata will not be retained (e.g. document creation date will be the date the document was transferred into GCdocs). 
The migration strategy will ensure that that the necessary metadata is mapped and integrity maintained when documents are migrated into GCdocs from EKME and shared drives. Directorates should also raise these issues when the Information Management business analysts meet with them to discuss their requirements for their GCdocs folder structure.

No. DFO’s vast shared drives are not well organized at this time and contain many duplicate and transitory documents that do not need to be transferred into GCdocs. It would not be the best use of resources to migrate a large amount of unorganized documents without first ensuring that only information resources of business value were being transferred. Understandably, cleaning up our shared drives will require substantial resources (human, financial, and time) that many directorates do not have readily available at this time thus we are suggesting that sectors at a minimum take a ‘day forward’ approach. This requires that they begin saving anything currently being worked on from that point on within GCdocs, including anything regularly opened or used. A migration strategy is in development.

No. Many DFO employees have gotten accustomed to using MS Outlook as an information management tool because of its great search capacity; however, this will soon become increasingly problematic for individuals. Personal Storage Table (PST) files will soon no longer be supported and thus individuals will no longer be able to open them or repair them should they become corrupted. In addition, inbox sizes will soon be capped at 1.5 GB. Many from di within Outlook making the process easy, depending on personal preference. Employees will quickly learn to view email as either transitory (can be deleted) or as an information resource of business value (should be saved in an appropriate, accessible folder within GCdocs) instead of just keeping every email and relying on the search function within MS Outlook.

The search function in GCdocs is very powerful. It has full-text search capability which means that GCdocs will look for the key words you provided in a document name and in the body of documents and emails. The use of email folders will make searching easier as well because more fields are viewed.

For maintaining the integrity of the email (legal purposes), you should not change the subject header on an email when you save it into GCdocs. It is possible, however it is not recommended. It is important to properly name emails at the time of creation so that the subject header reflects the email content. You can also add details of the email into the description field so that the email is easy to find. Both the content of the email and the description field are full-text searchable. The use of email folders allows one to rename the record without changing the subject line.

Saving an encrypted email into GCdocs should be avoided: In the event that the owner of that email leaves the Department, there is no way to decrypt the message, rendering the content useless. Emails should be decrypted prior to saving them in GCdocs. Remember, permissions can be restricted once in GCdocs to ensure proper security of the information contained therein. Please note that that key Information Management employees will be able to adjust these permissions accordingly if the owner were to leave the Department. Information up to and including Protected B can be saved in GCdocs without encryption, with the folder permissions/restrictions in place to ensure that the information is available to only those who need access.

No, not yet. The folder structure, or file plan for DFO / Canadian Coast Guard is currently in developments collaboratively with Directorates in 2018/19. Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has developed a generic folder structure for Internal Services (e.g. human resources, finance) however, this will have to be adjusted through consultation with directorates to meet DFO needs. In addition, a folder structure for our programs and operations will need to be created during this period. The 'Open for Business' principles will be used to create the folder structure.

GCdocs has the capability to see a document through each stage of the information management life cycle, including disposition. Please note, disposition will not occur without the final approval by the Office of Primary Interest (OPI). When records have met their retention period, a report will be generated and sent to the OPI (e.g. Director of the unit) requesting approval for their disposition. Existing retention and disposition schedules will be incorporated into the folder structure when setting up each folder. Each document within a folder will inherit its retention period and its permissions however, an OPI can decide to keep a document longer than its established retention period if it remains to be of business value.

Disposition date will be determined by the relevant retention and disposition schedule and the triggers previously identified. These may be lengthened at the request of the appropriate directorate if necessary, but they cannot be shortened without a complete review of the applicable retention and disposition schedule due to the legal implications.

The management of versions is quite versatile and comprehensive in GCdocs. Whether a directorate will use linear (1, 2, 3, etc.) or major and minor (1.0, 1.1, 1.2 1.3, 2.0, etc.) versions will be decided by individual directorates. While the Information Management Branch will provide guidelines and best practices, it recognizes that version management is highly preferential and the Branch will not enforce one way or another.

GCdocs will allow you to create subfolders once you are down to a certain level of the folder structure. However, it would be wise to limit the number of subfolders your work unit creates to promote a better filing structure and avoid having to drill down too many layers to get to your documents. The GCdocs team will work with directorates to create a folder structure that best meets business requirements.

No. As with folder structure, having a set naming convention can help reduce the guessing game for employees who are searching for specific documents. A naming convention will not be prescribed, but rather suggested as a best practice. It will not be enforced by the IM Branch, but can be enforced within a directorate. Finding documents in GCdocs will be much more intuitive with the new folder structure and if required, the search function for findings misplaced documents is so refined that it can find key words in titles and document content. You can also search using the Boolean Search function (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search.
